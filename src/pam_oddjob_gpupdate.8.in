.SH NAME
pam_oddjob_gpupdate.so - PAM module to update group policy via oddjob

.SH SYNOPSIS
session optional /lib/security/pam_oddjob_gpupdate.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIpam_oddjob_gpupdate.so\fR module checks if the user exists it invokes
the \fIgpupdatefor\fR
method of the \fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob_gpupdate\fR service for the \fBPAM_USER\fR
if the module is running with superuser privileges. Otherwise, it ignores.

If \fID-Bus\fR has not been configured to allow the calling application to
invoke these methods provided as part of the \fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob_gpupdate\fR
interface of the \fI/\fR object provided by the
\fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob_gpupdate\fR service, then \fIoddjobd\fR will not receive
the request and an error will be returned by \fID-Bus\fR.

If \fIoddjobd\fR has not been configured to provide these methods, or the
user is not authorized to use them, then \fIoddjobd\fR will ignore the
module's requests.

.SH OPTIONS
The module takes no options.  What \fIoddjobd\fR does in response to the
module's request is controlled by the daemon's configuration file, typically
\fI@mysysconfdir@/oddjobd.conf.d/oddjobd-gpupdate.conf\fR.
